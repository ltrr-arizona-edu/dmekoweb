Two components of this project are the extension of cool-season precipitation information to the millennial time scale and the investigation of the warm-season precipitation signal.  As one approach to the warm-season signal we are developing a network of latewood-width chronologies from various parts of western North America.  Dave Stahle and Malcolm Cleaveland ( U Arkansas) are collaborators in this research under a related NOAA award.<p>

An extension was granted in 2000 to allow the the research to be expanded to an detailed examination of the latewood width signal in a daily precipitation data set.
