U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division<br>
<br>
Award Period:		01/01/00 - 12/31/01
<br>
<p>This is part of a cooperative agreement between the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Arizona in which graduate students are supported in various types of thesis work.  One supported area is "reconstruction of growing conditions of riparian trees using dendrochronological analysis, with an emphasis on reconstructing hydrological time series -- surface-water flow and (or) ground-water discharge -- using advanced statistical techniques.  
 </p>
<a href="kiyomi01.html#imgkm001">Kiyomi Morini, </a>o, a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography, is being funded by the agreeement.  Kiyomi's research deals with growth and ring-width variations of Freemont cottonwood and other riparian species in southeastern Arizona.
