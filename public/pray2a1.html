[Though this project is ended, we are still working on publications]
<br>
<p>
The main objective is to provide information on the variability of water supply to Southern California. Tasks include field collections of tree-ring samples, development of chronologies, statistical reconstruction of annual flows and precipitation, and interpretation of reconstructions. Dr. Erica Bigio is a post-doc with major responsibilities on the project. </p>
