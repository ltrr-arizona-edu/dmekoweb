The long version of the title is "Millennial context for recent hydroclimatic changes in Ob River basin from tree
rings".  A main objective of this study is long-term information on variability of Ob River, Siberia, inflow to the Arctic Ocean. Additional funding was obtained after 03/31/2015 to fund a trip to Russia by Panyushkina and a trip to LTRR by Agafonov to develop journal articles </p>
