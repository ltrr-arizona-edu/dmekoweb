The main objective is to provide information on the variability of hydroclimate of the Carson-Truckee River Basin over decades to centuries. Collaboration is with Franco Biondi (University of Nevada, Reno). Tasks include application of modern tree-ring data, including cell anatomical data, in the framework of a water balance model in producing field reconstructions of water-balance parameters over the basin. MS candidate Anabel Winitsky joined the project in Fall Semester, 2020. </p>
