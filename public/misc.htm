The Meko household is made up of Linda, Dave and Matt.  Linda's a Program Coordinator in the UA College of Public Health.  Matt's is a senor in Howenstein High School.  (We are currently dogless, with the sad passing of Silkie and Lolly.)  We all love music.  Linda pretty much likes all kinds except maybe rap.  I'm a nut for buttonbox accordion music, and play in a garage band called "Hector and the Javelinas" with Barry Richards and Bill Mrosek.  Matt plays the accoustic bass, and played in the <a href="mattbass.html#orch1">Howenstein High School Orchestra</a> while it existed.
