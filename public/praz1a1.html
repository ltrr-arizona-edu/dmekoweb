The long version of the title is "Ob River Flood History from West Siberia Tree Rings".  A main objective of this study is identifying signatures in tree rings for floods along the Ob. A secondary objective is improvement of accuracy of a previous reconstructions of annual flows with information from a West Siberia network of temperature-sensitive trees. Key individuals on the project are Dr. Irina Panyushkina (senior personnel) and Leonid Agafonov (Russian collaborator). Most of the funding is for a 10-day visit of Meko, Panyushkina and a graduate student (Julie Edwards, a student of Kevin Anchukaitis, has volunteered!). </p>
