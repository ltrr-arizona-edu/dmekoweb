Award Period:		09/30/2007 - 09/30/2009
<br>
<p>
The long version of the title is "Riparian Thresholds: Using Dendrochronological Metrics to Evaluate Change".  The main objective is to pioneer the use of Netleaf Hackberry (Celtis reticulata) as a dendrochronological indicator of riparian health and riparian climate/growth relationships.  </p>

<div align="center"><H2>Research Topics</h2></div>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Develop hackberry chronologies from trees located on public and private land in the Santa Cruz, San Pedro, and Gila River watersheds 
<li>Explore dependency of ring width on tree age/size and the possibility of developing regional curves summarizing the dependency 
<li>Explore density differences in the early and late wood in each ring to measure for irregularities in wood density development trends as related to winter and monsoon precipitation patterns 
<li>Map water/tree growth relationships through time and space along the river
<li></li> Support and extend the tree ring water availability analysis by utilizing a simple regional water budget to understand how the system's water budget may have varied over the recent past beyond available stream gauging records
