The main objective is to provide information on the variability of freshwater and heat inflow to the Arctic Ocean from the Yenisei River. NSF collaboration is with a team of scientists from the University of New Hampshire (UNH). Tasks include field collections of tree-ring data, application of those data and existing tree-ring data to reconstruction of fluxes of heat and water, and integration of tree-ring data in a water-balance modeling and database framework that will more broadly encourage dendrohydrologic studies of Arctic Basins.  MS candidate Richie Thaxton joined the project in Fall Semester, 2020. </p>
